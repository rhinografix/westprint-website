# âœ… CSS FIXED - Deploy Now!

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Identified:
The `globals.css` file was missing the critical Tailwind v4 import:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

Without this import, Tailwind CSS was never initialized, so **none of your utility classes were processed**.

## âœ… Solution Applied:
Added `@import "tailwindcss";` as the **first line** of `/src/styles/globals.css`.

---

## ðŸš€ DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add missing Tailwind CSS import to globals.css"
git push
```

---

## ðŸ“Š What Will Happen:

1. âœ… Netlify receives your push
2. âœ… Installs dependencies (tailwindcss@4.0.0)
3. âœ… Vite processes `globals.css` with Tailwind
4. âœ… All utility classes get generated
5. âœ… CSS bundle included in `dist/assets/index-xxxxx.css`
6. âœ… **Site looks perfect at westprint.com!**

**Build time:** ~2-3 minutes

---

## ðŸŽ¨ What This Fixes:

- âœ… All Tailwind utility classes (bg-*, text-*, flex, grid, etc.)
- âœ… Responsive breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- âœ… Custom theme colors (primary, secondary, accent)
- âœ… All ShadCN component styling
- âœ… Custom animations (animate-fade-in, etc.)
- âœ… Typography system
- âœ… Spacing, borders, shadows - everything!

---

## ðŸŽ‰ This Will Work!

The site will now render with **full styling** as designed. All components will look professional with proper colors, spacing, and animations.
