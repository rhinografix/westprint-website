## ❓ Why Did Build Fail?

The `/src/components/ui/` folder only had 2 files but needs all 49 UI component files.

**Solution:** Copy files from `/components/ui/` to `/src/components/ui/`

## ✅ After Copying & Pushing

Your site will be live at:
- **Temporary URL:** your-site-name.netlify.app
- **Your Domain:** westprint.com (after DNS setup)
