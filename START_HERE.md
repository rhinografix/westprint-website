# 🚀 Westprint Website - Quick Start

## 🚨 NETLIFY BUILD FAILED?

Your `/src/components/ui/` folder is missing 46 UI component files.

### ⚡ YOU MUST RUN THIS ON YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER:

```bash
node copy-and-fix.js && git add . && git commit -m "Add UI components" && git push
```

**Important:** This must run on YOUR computer (laptop/desktop), not on GitHub!

📖 **Detailed Instructions:** `/RUN_LOCALLY_FIRST.md` ⭐

Netlify will auto-rebuild and your site will be live in ~3 minutes! ✅
